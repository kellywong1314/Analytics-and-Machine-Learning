# Advanced Regression to Predict Housing Sale Prices

This project is based on an active competition on Kaggle, where housing characteristics are used to predict housing sale prices in Ames, Iowa. The dataset contains 79 characteristics for almost 3,000 homes, half of which are used for training a regression model, while the other half is used to test the model and score it. This project outlines an initial attempt at some machine learning models to predict the housing sale prices, and resulted in a best RMSLE of 0.146.
